# BDD Test Automation Framework

A Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) test automation framework using Python, Selenium WebDriver, and pytest-bdd. This project demonstrates automated web testing with DuckDuckGo search functionality and includes automatic test result reporting to Jira.

## What This Project Does

### Automated Web Testing
- **Web Browser Automation**: Automatically opens web browsers and performs user interactions like searching, clicking, and verifying content
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Supports Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers with easy configuration switching
- **DuckDuckGo Search Tests**: Includes pre-built test scenarios that search for different terms and verify results
- **BDD Approach**: Tests are written in plain English using Gherkin syntax, making them readable by both technical and non-technical team members

### Jira Integration
- **Automatic Reporting**: Test results are automatically sent to your Jira project after each test run
- **Detailed Failure Information**: Failed tests include comprehensive error details, logs, and context to help with debugging
- **Test Execution Tracking**: Creates Jira issues to track test executions with timestamps and summaries

## How to Use

### 1. Initial Setup

#### Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install pipenv if you don't have it
pip install pipenv

# Install project dependencies
pipenv install

# Activate the virtual environment
pipenv shell
```

### 2. Configure Jira Integration (Optional)

#### Create Environment File
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your Jira credentials:
   ```
   JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@company.com
   JIRA_TOKEN=your-jira-api-token
   JIRA_SERVER=https://your-company.atlassian.net
   JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=YOUR_PROJECT_KEY
   ```

#### Getting Your Jira API Token
1. Go to your Jira account settings
2. Navigate to Security ‚Üí API tokens
3. Create a new API token
4. Copy the token to your `.env` file

**Note**: If you don't configure Jira, the tests will still run normally - they just won't report results to Jira.

### 3. Configure Browser Settings

Edit `tests/browserconfig.py` to customize your browser preferences:

```python
# Choose your browser: "Chrome", "Firefox", or "Safari"
select_browser = "Chrome"

# Browser options
browser_options = Options()
# Uncomment the next line to run tests without opening browser window
# browser_options.add_argument("--headless")
```

**Browser Options**:
- **Headless Mode**: Uncomment `browser_options.add_argument("--headless")` to run tests without opening browser windows
- **Browser Choice**: Change `select_browser` to "Firefox" or "Safari" to use different browsers

### 4. Understanding Test Scenarios

The tests are defined in `tests/features/web.feature` using simple English:

#### Basic Search Tests
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Basic DuckDuckGo Search
  When the user searches for "<phrase>"
  Then the search results should contain "<phrase>"

Examples:
| phrase |
| panda  |
| python |
| judge  |
```

#### Customizing Test Data
You can modify the test data by editing the Examples table:
- **Add new search terms**: Add more rows to the `| phrase |` column
- **Change search terms**: Replace existing terms with your preferred search queries

#### Long Text Search Tests
```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Lengthy DuckDuckGo search
  When user searches for the phrase:
  """
  Your long search text here...
  """
  Then one of the results contains "<expected_text>"
```

### 5. Running Tests

#### Run All Tests
```bash
pipenv run python -m pytest tests/step_defs/test_web.py -v
```

#### Run Specific Test Scenarios
```bash
# Run only basic search tests
pipenv run python -m pytest tests/step_defs/test_web.py::test_basic_duckduckgo_search -v

# Run only lengthy search tests
pipenv run python -m pytest tests/step_defs/test_web.py::test_lengthy_duckduckgo_search -v
```

#### Run Tests in Parallel (Faster)
```bash
pipenv run python -m pytest tests/step_defs/test_web.py -v -n auto
```

### 6. Understanding Test Results

#### Console Output
- **PASSED**: Test completed successfully
- **FAILED**: Test encountered an error (details will be shown)
- **Duration**: How long each test took to run

#### Jira Reports (if configured)
- A new Jira issue is created for each test run
- Failed tests include detailed error information and logs
- Test execution summaries show overall results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Browser not found**: Make sure you have Chrome, Firefox, or Safari installed
2. **Jira connection failed**: Check your `.env` file credentials and network connection
3. **Tests running slowly**: Enable headless mode in `browserconfig.py` for faster execution
4. **Import errors**: Make sure you're running tests with `pipenv run` to use the correct environment

### Getting Help

- Check the console output for detailed error messages
- Review the Jira issue comments for test failure details
- Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pipenv install`
